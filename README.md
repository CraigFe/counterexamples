# Counterexamples in Type Systems

This repo contains the source of [Counterexamples in Type
Systems](http://counterexamples.org), a compendium of horrible
programs that crash, segfault or otherwise explode.


### Building

Builds locally with `make` (if you're on a Linux system sufficiently like my own).

The book is built with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdbook)
and [KaTeX](https://katex.org).
